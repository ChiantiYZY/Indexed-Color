# Indexed-Color
The following codes gives two common algorithms generating color table for large .raw pictures. The codes will compress the large .raw file, generating the color table and output the compressed .bmp file.
Algorithms include population and uniform. The example main function and output functions are also provided. 
The input/output repository suppose to be customized. 

Assuming converting a 20*20 picture called pure.raw, sample inputs are as following:

-what file you want to compress?
-pure
-What is the height?
-20
-What is the width?
-20
